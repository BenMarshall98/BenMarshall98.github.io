<div id="content">
    <p>The aim for the coursework for this module was to develop a game engine based around Entity - Component - System (ECS) architecture that was capable of running a game across a network.</p>

<p>The game itself was fairly simple, in the center of the screen there was a pyramid of balls. This pyramid could have a different number of layers, from 3 - 50, affecting how many balls were on the screen. A projectile could be fired from the camera to the center of the pyramid knocking any balls it hits off the pyramid.</p>

<p>The only graphics required was simple lighting on the balls and the floor, however I soon found that rendering each ball individually caused the graphics to be very resource intensive. To combat this I implemented a ‘smart’ renderer that noted how many times a particular set of resources were being used, if it was over a threshold it would try to load in a instanced version of the shader and render the set of resources using instancing. This allowed even the biggest pyramid to render at a smooth frame rate.</p>

<p>I also decided to implement the rendering as that it would work for OpenGL and DirectX, for this I used OpenGL 4.3 and DirectX 11 as they both had constant buffers allowing the shaders to work in the same way. In the end the only changes required from a end developer point of view was changing a macro value (changing if OpenGL or DirectX was compiled), and providing the equivalent shaders.</p>

<p>Another limiting factor to the game was the physics. For this I used a octree to reduce the number of times it had to run collision detection. The physics also ran on a seperate thread to the graphics allowing both to run for longer without impacting on the frame rate. To prevent the graphics from stopping the physics to request information I used a double buffer which allowed the sycnoization process to happen at the end of the frame.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the project was the networking side. For this I built two copies of the game scene, one would work with a server and the other a client. The server acts like a master copy, it runs the game at a fixed frame rate, and sends updates to each client as and when required (on a seperate thread).</p>

<p>Each client can run at different frame rates, to compensate for this the server sends a message stating its current time (from projectile first being fired), and the client keeps updating that value, until it told a new value. It then interpolates between the servers time and the clients time and the client / servers ball positions to get the correct client ball positions.</p>
