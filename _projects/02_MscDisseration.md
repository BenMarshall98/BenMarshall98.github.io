As part of my disseration for the MSc I am implemented a library capable of generating navigation meshes. The main generation process is based on Recast, this is then being extended to include functionality such as pathfinding and automating the process for adding jump links.

As this is a ongoing project there is no video or further details. However below are some screenshots taken during the early stage of the project.
